#### Problem specification

We would like to create an app that will increase the student's interest in exploring the university campus using techniques such as persuasive technology and gamification. This will increase student awareness of the campus environment, encourage walking around campus as opposed to other means of transport, as well as increase engagement within the student community. 



#### Proposed problem & solution

We know that there are many students who love the campus cat Napoleon. However, many of us will rarely see the campus cat as no one really knows about his whereabouts other than the occasional social media post and word of mouth. We would like to create an website app where students can share their captures of Napoleon when they see him and share their location and time of taking the picture (if they choose to upload and share their image). 

With the images that students upload to our web app, we can create a curated feed based on the different places around campus where students can find Napoleon, but more importantly incentivize students to walk around campus in hopes of finding Napoleon (but they will not be able to find his exact location - because he has free will to roam around). Older images (more than a day ago) will be included in the general feed of images and students can view the profiles of those who have uploaded their pictures of Napoleon.

With increased engagement, we can reward users either through digital assets such as stickers and wallpapers, but as well as that our goal is to raise money for the animal welfare charity RSCPA. We would also like to reward users with badges for high quality or consistent content posts.
